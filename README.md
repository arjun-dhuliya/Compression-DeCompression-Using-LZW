# Compression-DeCompression-Using-LZW

Implemented LZW for compressing and UnCompressing files with text

the compression ratio is 60% (60% less size than original size).

I have provided few txt input files to check the program.

plus if u want to check it on any other file just open test program and change the inputFile name string on top

You can run MyCompressionTest Class to run and check out the program
